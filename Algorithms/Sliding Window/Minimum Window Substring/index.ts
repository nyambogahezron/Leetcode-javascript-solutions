/**
 * Problem: Minimum Window Substring (Advanced)
 * 
 * Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
 * The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
 * 
 * Example:
 * s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
 * Output: "BANC"
 * 
 * Challenge: Can you solve this in O(m + n) time?
